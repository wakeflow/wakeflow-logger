## Intro

We use this repo to send logs to the Google Cloud Platform

## Installation
```
npm i wakeflow-logger
``` 
## Usage

```
import { Logger } from 'wakeflow-logger'

const logger = new Logger({projectId:'example-project-id'})

logger.info('this is info',{payload:"this is a json payload"})
logger.warn('this is a warning',{payload:"this is a json payload"})
logger.error('this is an error',{payload:"this is a json payload"})
```
## Development mode

If you are working on your local machine, logs are sent to console.log

Only if `NODE_ENV=production` do logs get sent to GCP

## Viewing logs

To view your logs go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/logs

and enter the query `labels.wakeflow="wakeflow"`

Make sure you're looking at the correct GCP project.
